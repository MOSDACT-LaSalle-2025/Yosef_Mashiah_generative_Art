Generative Square Cells By Yosef Mashiah

A Processing sketch that draws a grid of square cells.
Each cell displays a gradient from white to a unique color, with a rotating hand in the center.

When the hand of one cell touches the hand of a neighboring cell,
that cell reverses its rotation direction and changes to a new color.

Because the colors and directions are constantly shifting, the work is generative:
the composition evolves in real time, producing endless variations.
